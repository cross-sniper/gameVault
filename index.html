welcome to nightmare run, a game made by cross the hedgehog(cross-sans/cross-sniper)<br>

<br>

this game is supposed to be part of gameVault, but i only have the repo as a part of a app on my phone(yes, i made a webview app on my phone)<br>

<br>

<p> bellow this is just some background text</p><br>

<button onclick="goto('main menu')">TL;DR start playing</button><br>

<br>

<br>

so, yeah, if you went through my repos, you know i dont make big projects, but anyhow<br>

<br>

this game is still a work-in-progress, as well as the runtime(neo runtime) and compiler(xbuild), they are a part of the repo this website is on, in case you wanna have a look at how they work<br>

<br>

<a href="build.js">xbuild</a><br>

<a href="runtime.js">neo runtime</a><br>

<br>

the source files for the game are included as well, under "src"<br>

<br>

<br>

if you find any bugs, report on my github, you will know if the bug occoured, because the game will alert you about it, and probably reset in the process<br>

<br>

<br>

<button onclick="goto('main menu')">lets get playing</button><br>

<br>

    <script src="runtime.js"></script>
